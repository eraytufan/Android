It is a very simple Android application which uses Gyroscope. The main objective of the user is to make him on the balance by using gyroscope of the phone. The user has to turn the phone to left or right to keep the man on the balance. The idea came from the video games such as Tomb Raider where she had to walk on the on a rope while she was trying keep her balance.

It was a basic Android Application to get to learn about Android gyroscope usage.
