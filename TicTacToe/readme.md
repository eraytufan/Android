Since I created the game before the dawn of time it is mostly a hard code. However it still has easy, hard and 2 people mode.

### TODO if I want to make it a little bit enjoyable and look professional. 
1. Refactor Code
2. Better User Interface
3. Maybe use AI algorithms instead of using conditions of everything. (However with this technique, I was able to write unbeatable AI. Since I thought there is no fun in that I changed it. Now in the hard mode, you have like 30% of winning chance even if you do everything correctly.)
4. Save scores against AI.
