Since I created the game before the dawn of time it is a hard code. I can't even believe how bad this code is. However it still has easy, hard and 2 people mode. 

### TODO if I want to make it a little bit enjoyable and look a little professional. 
1. Refactor Code
2. Better User Interface (I mean change it completely. It looks horrible). Creating from scratch would be better.
3. Maybe use AI algorithms instead of using conditions of everything. (However with this technique, I was able to write an unbeatable AI :). Since I thought there is no fun in that I changed it. Now, in the hard mode, you have like 30% of winning chance even if you do everything correctly.)
4. Save scores against AI.
5. More enjoyable AI.
